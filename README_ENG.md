# PlayerThingsPaperBin
 This is version 2.0.6 of the resource pack IN HONOR OF THE SECOND SEASON OF THE GREAT PaperBin to change the texture
 when renaming items from the PaperBin community.

 Some of the hidden meanings have been lost in translation, I am sorry.

 If you want to add your own item and you are a PaperBin player, then draw a texture and text me the name and what the item is.

# Installation
 1. For the resource pack to work, you need to get the PlayerThingsPaperBin folder from the folder that you downloaded and put it in .minecraft/resourcepacks IMPORTANT!!! If you have other resource packs that change the textures of items, these resource packs may conflict, to fix this, move this resource pack to the very top in the minecraft resource pack menu!
